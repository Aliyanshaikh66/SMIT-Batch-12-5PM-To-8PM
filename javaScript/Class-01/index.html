    <!-- <h1>Hello World</h1> -->
    <!-- !-- In JavaScript, variable names are subject to certain rules that dictate what is considered legal or illegal. Here’s a breakdown:

    Legal Variable Names

    1.Letters, Digits, Underscores, and Dollar Signs**: 
    Variables can start with a letter (a-z, A-Z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
    After the first character, digits (0-9) can be included.
    Examples: `myVariable`, `_privateVar`, `$amount`, `var123`.

    2. **Case Sensitivity**: 
    - Variable names are case-sensitive. For instance, `myVar` and `MyVar` are different variables.

    3. **Unicode Characters**:
    - Variable names can include Unicode characters. For example, `变量`, `変数`, and `변수` are all valid.

    4. **No Reserved Keywords**: 
    - Variable names cannot be JavaScript reserved keywords or future reserved words. Examples of reserved keywords include `var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `return`, etc.

    ### Illegal Variable Names

    1. **Starting with Digits**:
    - Variable names cannot start with a digit. For example, `123abc` is illegal.

    2. **Containing Spaces**:
    - Spaces are not allowed in variable names. For example, `my variable` is illegal.

    3. **Using Special Characters**:
    - Special characters such as `@`, `#`, `!`, `-`, etc., are not allowed. For example, `my-variable` and `my@var` are illegal.

    4. **Reserved Words**:
    - You cannot use JavaScript reserved words or keywords as variable names. Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `break`, etc.

    5. **Empty Names**:
    - Variable names cannot be empty. For example, `var ` (with no name after `var`) is illegal.

    ### Examples

    **Legal Variable Names:**
    ```javascript
    let age = 25;
    const _name = 'Alice';
    var $price = 19.99;
    let userName = 'Bob';
    let count2 = 10;
    ```

    **Illegal Variable Names:**
    ```javascript
    let 2count = 10; // Starts with a digit
    let my variable = 'test'; // Contains a space
    let my-var = 'test'; // Contains a hyphen
    let function = 'test'; // Reserved word
    ```

    In general, following these rules will help you avoid syntax errors and ensure your JavaScript code is both valid and functional.
